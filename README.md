## ⭐ Purpose of This Public Version

This public version exists exclusively to:

- Demonstrate engineering quality, architecture, and development style  
- Showcase UI/UX foundations, PWA structure, and component design  
- Allow recruiters and technical reviewers to evaluate front-end work  
- Share a safe, sanitized preview of a real client project

The full production system remains private and significantly broader in scope.
